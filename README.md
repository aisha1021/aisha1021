### 🌟 About Me
Hey! I'm Aisha, a student with a strong drive for building things that make a difference. I’ve been fascinated by the power of technology to tackle real-world challenges, from predicting water quality using satellite imagery to crafting helpful web applications. My academic background is sprinkled with experiences in machine learning, data analysis, and a bit of design, and I’m always on the lookout for new learning adventures. 

I’m all about **continuous improvement** and **hands-on learning**—whether it’s developing algorithms for remote sensing or diving deep into frontend frameworks. When I’m not coding, I might be exploring new coffee spots, working on some DIY projects, or planning my next travel destination! 🌍
